# The Focus Project Curriculum

The Focus Project (FOCUS) is an open-source curriculum for learning. Our curriculum is divided into distinct courses,
each covering the subject in depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple questions.
These questions give users the opportunity to practice what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying
the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed answered questions may then be reviewed by the users if
they wish to revisit the questions.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated
resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repo contains the actual lesson files used on our website. For the actual FOCUS app that pulls in this lesson
content and contains our front-end and back-end code, please go to the main FOCUS repo.

Our community can be found on the FOCUS Discord server.

## Contributing

The Focus Project depends on open-source contributions to improve, grow, and thrive. We welcome contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds to help maintain this awesome curriculum and community.
